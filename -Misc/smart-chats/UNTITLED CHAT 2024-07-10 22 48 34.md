Read [[Affordance]]

##### assistant
Based on your notes, "Affordance" refers to the potential actions or interactions that an observer can engage in with various aspects of reality. It is essentially a means for an observer to interact with a focus. For instance, a book might afford learning, a tranquil garden might afford meditation, and a challenging situation might afford growth. This concept highlights the possibilities and opportunities presented by different objects or environments to an observer, emphasizing the interactive potential between an observer and their surroundings.

1. **Projec-tion (Explorer)**
- **Proficiency:** Focusing
- Focuses on altering an Observer’s Focus.
2. **Archivist (Contextualization)**
- **Proficiency:** Contextualizing
- Dedicated to discovering, understanding, and documenting Reality.
3. **Artificer (Identification)**

- Involves identifying and Naming Aspects.
4. **Conjuration**
- **Proficiency:** Manifesting
- The practice of bringing a Construct or Astral Aspect to the Material Focus.
5. **Divination**
- **Proficiency:** (Not specified)
- Aimed at gaining information from outside one’s known Reality.
6. **Domain Control (Manipulation)**
- **Proficiency:** Controlling
- Focuses on manipulating and managing a Domain.
7. **Projection**

8. **Shadow Work (Introspection)**
- **Proficiency:** Diving

Your notes suggest that proficiency in all schools is important for navigating The World effectively. Each school is associated with specific items, affordances, focus locations, etc., and there's a consideration to maybe rename it to Schools of Affordances, with each school having a proficiency in the art.

Proficiency name for the Divination school in [[School]]

##### assistant
Based on your notes, the proficiency name for the Divination school was not explicitly mentioned. To maintain consistency with the naming convention of the other schools and their proficiencies, a suitable proficiency name for the Divination school could be "Perceiving." This aligns with the school's focus on gaining information from outside one’s known Reality, emphasizing the act of perception beyond the ordinary senses.
