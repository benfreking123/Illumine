An Anchor that is a small Wizard statue with a staff in one hand and a crystal ball in another. A Sigil of “Guide” is inscribed on the bottom with the word ‘Purpose’ above it.

## Notes
This Anchor functions by tying the Sigil of “Guide” to the statue, by looking at the statue and remembering what your purpose is; you are reminded of your stated purpose which is to Guide. 

Placed at a workplace the individual is constantly reminded of their goal and purpose.


The sigil can be replaced by any other and so can the object that is used as the Anchor but tying a Sigil representing your purpose to an Object is a powerful tool to stay on course.
