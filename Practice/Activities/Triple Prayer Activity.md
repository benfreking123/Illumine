The Triple Prayer Activity is a set of three prayers, morning, day, and night. These prayers can be structured any way the practitioner sees fit as long as they are with purpose and intent. 
# Goal
To deepen one's connection with [[God]], a [[Dieties|Deity]], or another [[Aspect]] and to create an open dialogue and means of communication to the Divine.
# Notes
Prayer is about gratitude and a dialogue with the divine, not a half baked conversation of wants, desires, and complaints. 

Its important to remember prayer is not simply asking for something, but communicating. Share your emotions and thoughts, leave moments to listen and contemplate. Prayer is not just a list of wants, but of appreciation, goals, thanks, and more. 

However, prayer can become much deeper with the introduction of [[Name]] and Symbols. Some prayers are meant to be sacred and to use specific language or iconography to express the religious ideas. Its important to not only respect these prayers and their structure but the specific [[Name|Names]] used in the prayer.
