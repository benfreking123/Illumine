## Notes
For example, a book might afford learning, a tranquil garden might afford meditation, and a challenging situation might afford growth.

Some of the most basic spiritual affordances that are done every day are thinking and praying, where the Observer is interacting with things not fully understood, but there is still a measurable interaction happening. 
Others involve, touching an item to move it, or breathing where your body affords with the air to extract oxygen from it to sustain life. 
Every single event in the world can be describe as an Affordance between Aspects in a specific Focus (or in many specific Focuses)
