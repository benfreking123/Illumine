A Location at [[The Edge]] that is used to exploring over the edge.

## Notes
The lighthouses are always presented as cut in half as the other half is over [[The Edge]].

Used to explore the unknown or nothing to turn it into something or existence. A means to convert nothing into god, maybe be a vital tool in creating a new world or focus.
