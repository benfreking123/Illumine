## Use:
###### Attunement:
To attune your Pendulum extend your arm in front of yourself while dangling it by it's chain or string. 
Start by asking simple questions with definitive yes or no answers. Note which direction the pedant moves in response to the definitive yes or no question. This will be the method of [[Divination]] using the pendant.

###### Actions:
Extend your pendant as described in the Attunement section then ask a direct question mentally or verbally that can be answered with a yes or no answer. Then read how the pendulum swings.
