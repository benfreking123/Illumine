## Notes
Emanations of God
Aspects are anything anyone can distinguishes as a 'part of reality'. Aspects are about recognition, something as simple as notice a tree in a forest.
For instance love, but also a chair, a human, all of humanity, the sun, an atom, a thought, a memory, even your imagination. 

It is an observable distinction between something and everything else.
