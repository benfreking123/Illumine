## Servitor
- **Appearance** - Resembling a black backpack, Mulken has four mechanical arms that are connected to a ridged structure attached to the Perceivers back, pieces of Mulken wrap over the top shoulders, while parts wrap around the ribs, and finally Mulken anchors itself to the bottom of the spine.  
- **Anchors** - A Colorful Rubber Ducky
- **Call** - The word ‘Mulken’ said in the mind with intent
- **Drive** - Support
- **Dwelling** - [[Beholder’s Armory]]
