Short writings of Ideologies or applications of what has been seen or experienced.
Psalms or prayers, beliefs of the universe.

Every single event in the world can be describe as an Affordance between Aspects in a specific Focus (or in many specific Focuses)

The Demiurge created time, the failure of this world. When the demiurge created our world, it did so alone, lacking in a second half needed for creation. It lacked duality, the only thing in our universe that lacks duality.

'What is God'
'Who are We - How are we made - What is our Purpose'

Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted
The Law of Free Will
As Above So Below
God is Everything
Let my purpose guide me; as my purpose is to guide


God that is Everything
The Eminator that creates 
The Understanding in between

Just as a human Eminits their reality, God would be that which is eminated, the colors, the sounds, everything, the Eminiator, being me the Observer, that which creates. And then the thing inbetween, Jesus, that which corrects or changes the emination, that which understand the expreience.

God look at itself, and said I am that, that is not me. Creating the three divisions of the Highest God. God the Observer and 'I', God the Eminination and 'that', God the Jesus and 'that is not me'.
You have the creator, that which is created, and the understanding that those things are seperate. This is shown through the doctorine 'As Above So Below' in humans who are Observers, seeing a reality their own body created, and then trying to understand how these things are seperate and different.
