I sit here contemplating the not of "Focus" and I'm struck by lack of nauce and laungage around the topic of 'where am I looking', what am I 'seeing'. I can be looking at something, but what am I really focused on? "Focus" is not just a simple term; it’s a key to unlocking how we perceive and engage with reality itself. "Focus" isn't about mere attention or concentration—those ideas only scratch the surface. Instead, Focus represents something far more profound: **Focus refers to a distinct state of consciousness or category of experience that shapes how an Observer perceives and interacts with reality.**

Every experience, every state we find ourselves in—whether we're grounded in the material world, lost in thought, or perhaps even traversing the strange and abstract—comes back to this idea. Each of these states filters our perception, revealing different aspects of existence. Like a colored lens, a particular Focus can show us one version of reality, but it can also obscure others. That metaphor sits with me.

Unique category of experience or Focus can be placed in one of three categories: [[Material Focus|Material]], [[Lucid Focus|Lucid]], and [[Astral Focus|Astral]]. The [[Material Focus]]—the physical world—is where most of us live by default. It’s governed by the rules of physics, the tangible, the objective reality that we all share. It’s simple enough to grasp: it’s where I stub my toe, eat breakfast, and go about the mundane.

Then there’s the [[Lucid Focus]]. I understand this intuitively as the space of thought, memory, and imagination. Here, I can play with the abstract, where my dreams and daydreams take shape, where the boundaries are far less rigid. This is where potential forms before it’s ever anchored into the material. Pondering specific Focus like the [[Imagination Focus]] or [[Memory Focus]] you soon realize just the amount of time that is spent in these Lucid Focus. Yet, it’s strange to think of this space as its own distinct space, where I can create, destroy, and even project into new possibilities.

Lastly the space the enthralls me the most; the [[Astral Focus]]. It feels mysterious, elusive, almost like a myth. . It points to something beyond both mind and matter, hinting at deeper layers of existence—places I might have only glimpsed in meditative states or through dedication to [[Projection]]. Astral Focus are vaguely defined and hard to describe, they lack the structure and logic and order human's are so used to in the lower Focus. Experiences in these Focus are grand and over taking, I find a calling to map them and explore them. To start to define the absurd and abstract. To bride the land of the material with that of the heavens in a bid to bring God closer to [[The World]].

What I find the most useful is that these Focuses aren’t entirely separate. There’s an interplay between them, a potential to merge Focuses. An idea that opens so many possibilities—could I use the creative potential from the Lucid Focus to manifest something in the Material? I’m reminded of times when visualization, prayers, or dreaming seemed to translate into real-world outcomes. The use of one focus to influence another is key in [[Magick]] and this idea is frequently called on by an assortment of [[Magickal Items|Magick Items]]. 

The concept of [[Projection]]—shifting consciously between these Focuses—is a skill I need to refine. There is a way to mastery these shifts, to find a deeper awareness of how to experience reality.

In conclusion, this idea of Focus is a tool—it’s something I can use to navigate my reality more effectively. The material, lucid, and astral—these are all ways of seeing, ways of being, and learning to shift between them, even to blend them, might be the key to deeper magickal practice. I have much more to explore, but for now, I’ll keep this concept at the forefront of my thoughts. It may be the lens through which I reshape my understanding of reality itself.
