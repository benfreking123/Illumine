Every single event in the world can be describe as an Affordance between Aspects in a specific Focus (or in many specific Focuses)
### **The Framework of Reality: A System for Seeing and Interacting with the Unseen**

The complexities of reality often elude us because the language we use is limited—insufficient to fully describe or engage with the deeper layers of existence. This framework offers a new way of seeing, a system designed to bridge the gap between the tangible world and the unseen realms that shape our experiences. It is an approach to reality that empowers every human being to not only perceive the world around them but to interact with it in a meaningful, intentional way.

At the heart of this system are three foundational elements: **Focus**, **Aspect**, and **Affordance**. These are not just abstract concepts but tools of perception and action. Each plays a vital role in structuring our understanding of reality and enabling us to engage with it directly.

#### **Focus: The Lenses of Perception**

"Focus" is the lens through which we experience reality, a distinct state of consciousness or category of experience that shapes what we see and how we interact with the world. Focus is not merely attention—it is the frame of mind, the state of being that determines what is possible to observe and engage with.

Focus exists in three primary states:

- **Material Focus**: The physical world, where we operate by default. Governed by the laws of physics, this is the realm of touch, taste, sight—everything that can be physically observed and measured.
- **Lucid Focus**: The space of thought, imagination, and memory. In this state, the boundaries of the physical world blur, and abstract concepts and emotions take precedence. It is the realm of creativity, where the intangible becomes possible.
- **Astral Focus**: The mysterious, the spiritual, the beyond. Astral Focus refers to the higher planes of existence—spaces that lack the familiar structure of the material world but offer profound experiences that transcend normal perception.

These Focuses are not separate, but interwoven. Shifting between them, blending them, allows for deeper engagement with reality. **Focus** is the lens that reveals the specific layer of existence you are engaging with at any moment.

#### **Aspect: The Named Sections of Reality**

An **Aspect** is a distinct section of reality, a category of existence that has been recognized, perceived, and named. Naming is key—without naming an Aspect, it remains undifferentiated from the rest of reality. By naming it, we bring it into focus, enabling us to observe and, ultimately, interact with it.

Aspects can be anything—a physical object, a memory, an emotion, or even a person. They exist within Focuses and are shaped by the state of consciousness you are operating in. For example, a **Material Aspect** might be a rock, but that same rock might have a **Lucid Aspect** if it holds special meaning or significance, such as being "My Rock." Importantly, it’s not about giving the rock a standard definition of a name, like Rick the Rock, it’s about identifying this specific rock from everything else you can perceive.

Naming an Aspect is a way of grasping its essence, of distinguishing it from everything else. Once named, an Aspect becomes something you can direct your attention toward, communicate about, and ultimately influence.

#### **Affordance: The Mechanics of Interaction**

**Affordance** is how we interact with Aspects of reality. It is the action or method through which we engage with the world, whether through physical interaction, thought, or will. Affordances are what enable us to move from passive observation to active participation in shaping our reality.

To perform an Affordance, you must first name the Aspect you wish to interact with. The act of naming brings the Aspect into focus, making it distinct and available for engagement. Once an Aspect is named, an Observer can perform Affordances upon it—whether that involves manipulating a physical object, altering a memory, or even influencing future events through visualization or intention.

Affordances are the tools of creation and transformation within this system. They allow us to shape reality, blend Focuses, and bring abstract ideas into the material world. Through Affordances, we bridge the gap between thought and action, between the seen and the unseen.

### **A Language to Bridge the Divide**

This framework is not just a system for understanding reality—it is a language for bridging the disconnect humanity has with the unseen world. In modern times, we have grown disconnected from the subtle forces and experiences that shape our lives, lost in a paradigm that prioritizes the material while overlooking the deeper, more intricate layers of existence.

But reality is not just material. It is lucid, astral, and complex. It is shaped by what we observe, what we name, and how we choose to interact with it. This framework provides a common language, a way for every individual to talk about their experiences, both seen and unseen.

When we talk about Focus, we are discussing where and how we perceive the world. When we speak of Aspects, we are naming and categorizing what we encounter within that perception. And when we engage with Affordances, we are talking about the ways we interact with and influence those Aspects.

By giving language to these processes, we give ourselves the power to see more deeply into reality, to engage more fully with it, and to take conscious control over how we shape our lives. This system is a tool for empowering humanity to reconnect with the full spectrum of reality, both physical and metaphysical, and to understand that the unseen is just as real and impactful as the seen.

### **Conclusion: Seeing, Naming, Interacting**

This framework offers a structured yet flexible way of seeing and interacting with reality. By defining and naming Aspects, choosing where we place our Focus, and learning to perform Affordances, we gain the ability to shape our experience of the world with intention and awareness.

In doing so, we step into a deeper understanding of the unseen layers of existence, bringing them into conversation with the material world, and thus, closer to our everyday lives. This system is not just a way of perceiving—it is a way of participating in the creation of reality itself.
