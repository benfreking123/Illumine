I have always thought about [[God]], what he could be, what she should do, what it wants… But thats beside the point, I think god is not too hard to described, but he is hard to name. Because’s hes not embodied on this material plane in any conscious sense, he is not seen floating in the sky or using any grand feats to show his presence. Frankly any proof of god does not exist cause I think forcing god to be defined exactly like us, on this material plane, is missing the point.

Instead God is seen everywhere, he speaks through cracks in your mind and thoughts, through gentle gestures from a stranger, or through the crashing of waves on a sandy beach. In the sun, our words, our thoughts, he is found when you are quite, and still, and just want to listen, he is beyond us, outside of us, but still every close. I feel god is everything, every item, atom, every event, every memory, every thought, emotions, feelings, dream, everything…. All of it, put together. God is the name we call all of reality, that which we have seen, that which we have not seen, everything that is not nothing is God. It's everything everywhere forever.
