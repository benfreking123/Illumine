They came at the same time, the first three things I found in my contemplation of reality and the world, through experience of the grand blitz and pains of life. There exist three useful labels to categorize reality. 

There are [[Focus|Focuses]], places the viewer visits to experience that which is not simply material, something that is either a hallucination of the mind, a function of our anatomy or something that needs to be deeper described.

[[Aspect|Aspects]] are a fancy name for something we all understand, names, the ability to categorize this from that. If you name your dog, it is now separated from the rest of all other unnamed dogs. Aspects are my ability to name and ‘see’ something. Knowing the Name of something or the Aspect of reality you are able to interact with it!

These interactions are [[Affordance|Affordances]], the main tools of interacting with aspects of reality, if it’s grabbing a memory, or moving my hand for my phone. Affordances are the means our body, mind, and soul interact with our world.
